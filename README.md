# Ocular Handled Virtual Mouse Using Haar Cascade Algorithm

An innovative, hands-free human-computer interaction system that enables users to control the mouse cursor using **eye movements**, powered by **Haar Cascade** and **computer vision** algorithms. This technology aims to make computing more **accessible, inclusive, and intuitive**, especially for users with motor impairments.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **eye-controlled virtual mouse** that uses webcam input to detect and track the user's eyes. The system translates **gaze direction** into **cursor movement** and simulates mouse clicks using simple facial gestures (e.g., blink detection).

By leveraging real-time image processing and Haar Cascade classifiers, the system removes the need for traditional input devices like a physical mouse or trackpad.

### ⚙️ How It Works

The eye-controlled virtual mouse operates using real-time webcam input and computer vision techniques:

1. **Webcam Activation**  
   The system starts by accessing the webcam feed using OpenCV.

2. **Face and Eye Detection**  
   Haar Cascade Classifiers are used to detect the face and eyes in each frame.

3. **Eye Tracking**  
   The system tracks the eye region and identifies the direction of the gaze (left, right, center, up, down).

4. **Cursor Movement**  
   Based on gaze direction, the cursor is moved across the screen using the `PyAutoGUI` library.

5. **Click Detection (Optional)**  
   Blinks or sustained eye closure can be used as mouse click triggers using simple thresholding logic.

6. **Hands-Free Interaction**  
   This enables full control of the computer without any physical input device, making it ideal for accessibility and sterile environments.
